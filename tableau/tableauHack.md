## Accessing Tableau

**Tableau** is commercial software for data visualization and visual analytics.
It has its roots in academia, with colleagues at Stanford University driving it forwards.

<!-- We will be using it in the lab at City throughout the module and -->
You may find it useful during your studies and can install it on your own machines too under a _Student Course License_.

We will point you to some introductions, tutorials and materials, but you will need to spend plenty of time getting good at using **Tableau** in your own time.

<!--- div class="postIt" markdown=1 --->

<!---
I can't emphasise this enough - **please put time into learning Tableau early on in the module, and continue to do so throughout the term**.

My experience of teaching visualization using **Tableau** shows that it is an empowering tool that really helps students develop skills and make sense of data.<br/>
Some students go on to use Tableau in placements, projects, further degrees and jobs subsequently, which is fantastic.<br/>
But this experience also reveals a close correlation between:

- early use of **Tableau**, experimentation with it, and use of the online support materials, and
- **success in the module**.

So please use **Tableau** early on and use the support materials to experiment with it and get to know it.
--->

<!--- /div --->

<!--- --- 

### Computer Labs at City St George's

**Tableau Desktop** is installed in the Windows PC labs at the University.

As I write this (_January 2025_), it is called **Tableau 2024.N** on these machines and available through the alphabetically grouped application folders on the **Start menu**.<br/>(_N is a number that will be low at the start of the term, but may increase with software updates!_)

You can use Tableau on any of the machines in the computer labs, library or open access areas to undertake the work that you is required of you during this module.

 --- --->

### Installing on Your Computer(s)

As DIVERSE-CDT students you can get free use of **Tableau** on your notebook during the course through a _Student Course License_ for which I have applied.
The license lasts until the end of September 2026.

The instructions from the _Academic Programs Team_ at _Tableau Software_ follows.<br/>They say: 

<!---
> Please forward these instructions to students enrolled on _SG2047 Visualizing Society_:

<!-- You should get your _Tableau_ license straightaway, but if not, there's a 14-day free trial, so you can get started immediately regardless! -->

<!--- --- --->

### Tableau Public

There is also a free version of **Tableau** that only enables you to save and share data on _the cloud_ - [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover).

This is **not** what you need at this stage so **do not use Tableau Public** for your studies.

You may need more functionality than it offers and since it makes all of your datasets available publicly this will not be not suitable for some the datasets we'll be using.
I reiterate this is not suitable for your coursework.

So please avoid sharing the work that you undertake here or posting it online.
You may find it helpful later on when working on projects, placements or internships, but please just ignore [**Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) completely at this stage.

Outside of your studies, feel free to use your _Tableau_ and design skills to get involved in public data debate! But for now, use **Tableau Desktop**.

<!--- --- --->

## Getting Started with Tableau

We will be learning to use _Tableau Desktop_ today - software that allows you to explore and present data through visualization.

We would like you to work your way through the [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20224) tutorial videos.
This series of short videos are just over **20-minutes** in length in total. They show you how to visualise, analyse and present an example [Sample - Superstore](https://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/Sample%20-%20Superstore.xls) data set, which you should download.

We expect you to **watch each video** with _Tableau Desktop_ running on your computer. You should complete each step shown in the videos in _Tableau Desktop_. You will need to **pause each video after each action** so that you can **try all of the features that are introduced for yourself**. You must keep up to date and follow the instructions and actions on screen as you watch.

This should take **2 or 3 hours** in total and is **essential** grounding for the work we will do this term.

#### Start Tableau ...

You will need to start a copy of _Tableau Desktop_, which is available on the _Windows_ computers _in the labs at the University_.

As a student at City, you can also get hold a free copy of the _Tableau Desktop_ visualization software use on your laptop or at home, to help you learn and to complete your coursework.<br/>Instructions are here - _[Tableau Desktop](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824653)_

#### Sign up ...

You will need to sign up to access the tutorial - but this is a quick process and you can use the account that you create to access [Tableau Training Videos](https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824654) and other materials into the future.<br/>
When registering, you may want to enter the postcode for _City, University of London_, which is ...

- **EC1V 0HB**.

 <div style="background-color:#fff; margin :0.5em; align:center">

 <!-- <img style="padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em" src="https://staff.city.ac.uk/~jad7/pics/inm451/tableau.gettingStarted.2019.png" width=90%/> -->
 <img style="padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em" src="https://jsndyks.github.io/dump/img/tableau2022.tutorial.png" width=90%/>

 </div>

This activity should take you around **2-3 hours** - but you may need to spend more time experimenting with the various capabilities in the software. 

<!-- Time spent getting comfortable with Tableau and its features _now_ will reap significant rewards later on as we make more use of Tableau through the module. So it's a good idea to invest plenty of time into this as early in term as possible. -->

<!---
You should start the exercise in class and **must complete the work (and the checklist) before the next session** (next week).
 --->


Note that the tutorial uses a _business_ data set and enables you to create a '_Executive Overview Interactive Dashboard_' that shows _Profitability_. However, the kinds of variables that you work with here are not unlike those we use to understand, analyse and visualize society - as we will see.
So please stick with it and work through the tutorials step by step even though the data do not necessarily deal with a phenomenon that is of particular interest.

You will need to _download_ the [Sample - Superstore](https://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/Sample%20-%20Superstore.xls) spreadsheet from the Tableau site<br/>
   _This is available from the link under the first [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started) video._
   <br/> _Each **row** is a **record**, a thing for which we have some information._
   <br/> _Each **column** is a **data dimension**, a characteristic about the thing that we have some information about._ <br/>

<!-- 
#### What you need to do ...

1. **register** for the [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started) introductory videos to Tableau<br/>
   _You will need to provide some details to register - City's postcode is **EC1V 0HB**_ <br/>

1. **download** the [Sample - Superstore](https://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/Sample%20-%20Superstore.xls) spreadsheet from the Tableau site<br/>
   _This is available from the link under the first [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started) video._
   <br/> _Each **row** is a **record**, a thing for which we have some information._
   <br/> _Each **column** is a **data dimension**, a characteristic about the thing that we have some information about._ <br/>

1. **watch** the [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started) video

1. **follow** by **trying each step** so that you do (and learn) the basics by using _Tableau Desktop_<br/>
   _**IMPORTANT:**_ <span style="color:#b44"><em>do not use the cloud based version of Tableau - please do this work in your own local file space using</em></span> Tableau Desktop_.
   _You will need to frequently pause and replay the video to do exactly what is shown - copy what is going on and create the various graphics._
   _You may find it helpful to watch each video in full before going through the slower, step-by-step process of completing each of the actions for yourself. But make sure that you do go through the actions to recreate what you see on screen._ <br/>

1. **record** your progress on the [checklist of concepts]
(https://moodle4.city.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=824679)
 below 👇 as you go, to ensure that you have engaged with each of the concepts and capabilities listed.<br/>
   _Explore a little - try things out!<br/>Use your initiative to vary things as you try the functionality and techniques_ <br/>

1. **complete** the full set of [Getting Started Training Videos](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started) in turn, **watching** and **doing** each of the steps in your own copy of _Tableau Desktop_ :

   1. [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started) <code>1:00</code>
   1. [Tableau Cloud](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started-part2) <code>1:00</code>

1. **repeat** : try it all _again_ in your own time to consolidate!

#### IMPORTANT - There is Self-Tuition Aspect Here!

This activity should take you something in the region of **2 or 3 hours** - but you may need to spend more time experimenting with the various capabilities in the software.
**The more time you spend exploring Tableau and getting good at it - the better.** -->

<!---
Time spent getting comfortable with Tableau and its features **now** will reap rewards as we make more use of Tableau **through the module**.<br/>
<span style="color:#b44">Putting time and effort into learning Tableau <b>now</b> will certainly pay off <b>later</b> on.</span>

You should start the exercise in class and **must** complete the work before the next session.

- [ ] **extract** the data - know the difference between _live_ and _extract_ <br/>
      _(we will normally want to extract)_
- [ ] know and understand the difference between **dimensions** and **measures**
  - **measures** - **green** pills - these are _quantities_, numbers
  - **dimensions** - **blue** pills - these are _qualities_, categories (usually names)
- [ ] create a **hierarchy** of dimensions (categories)
- [ ] **hide** dimensions and measures
- [ ] **build** visualizations in the _sheet_ by dragging dimensions and measure fields to the _shelves_ and _cards_
- [ ] **calculate** _new variables (measures) - a \_calculated field_
- [ ] use the **back** or **undo** button<br/>
      _to get back to where you were - before you messed things up!_ - [ ] use **SAVE** to save a _TWBX workbook_ (a Tableau workbook with data)
- [ ] use '**Show Me**' to select possible chart types<br/>
      _this is the **one click option**, not a comprehensive list of possibilities_
- [ ] select a **colour scheme**
- [ ] **change** the end and centre points of a _diverging colour scheme_
- [ ] show and use a **filter** to select relevant data items _interactively_
- [ ] use the **row** and **column** shelves to split the screen and structure a graphic
- [ ] use the **marks shelf** to vary a graphic
- [ ] know the difference between **discrete** and **continuous** fields
- [ ] understand how Tableau uses **dates** (date parts and date values)
- [ ] use **dates** to aggregate data by different time periods
- [ ] use **SUM**, **AVG** and **COUNT** to aggregate rows in the data set
- [ ] change **axis parameters** - _range, scale, title, tick marks_

- [ ] edit **tooltips** to include _dynamic text_
- [ ] **filter** graphics _by date_, _interactively_.
- [ ] **rename** worksheets
- [ ] **duplicate** worksheets - you will need to make copies as you make changes

<!-- Check these concepts as you are introduced to them, and make a note of any that you find challenging or are unable to complete - we'll check back on these later. -->

<!--
#### Don't worry about ...

There are a few things you don't need to be concerned about at this stage ...

 * joins - we will only be using single files containing single tables
 * connections & integrated data sources
 * the relationships video
 * anything covered in the video after **23:45** on ...
   * publishing workbooks
   * Tableau server
   * subscriptions
   * _etc._

You won't need to know these concepts or use these features in your work on this module.
 -->

<!--
#### But do note that  ...

... during the Tutorial we're asked to decide ...

> "Which one looks best?"

and that we're informed that Tableau has an ...

> enormous variety of charts  in Tableau - **show me** is the one click option, not a comprehensive list of possibilities

Much of the module will involve trying to select and design appropriate graphics from the huge number of charts and variations that are available.

So, once you can use Tableau, you'll need to engage fully to get good at this!

### Tableau Demo

Sometime soon, perhaps at the end of the session, maybe at the start, maybe next week or later on the course ... or perhaps on video (!) ... I'll be showing you how to do a few more important things.

Make sure you can do them too ...

### Training Videos

Tableau provide a whole host of [_Free Training Videos_](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training).

Do use these excellent resources to learn **Tableau**.
<!-- and inform your work on the module. -->

You will find them extremely helpful as you master this important software for exploring and explaining structure in data as you visualize society.

Spend time searching through them, looking for tips, trying things out and mastering _Tableau_.

&nbsp;

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://jsndyks.github.io/sg2047/css/sg2047.css">

<!---
I **strongly recommend** that you spend at least **a few hours** watching and following these introductory training videos and experimenting with the concepts and functionality that they introduce in _Tableau_.

The concepts and functionality that feature are key to your successful use of _Tableau_ in _Visualizing Society_ and it is essential that you understand them.
Spend time with these videos as soon as you can and **before reading week** in preparation for the second assessed activity when you will use _Tableau_ to _Design a Data Graphic_.

Being able to use these ideas and the functionality that relies upon them now will help you immeasurably in using _Tableau_ to **Explore** and **Explain** effectively as you learn to _visualize society_ and develop designs and ideas in your coursework assignment.

--->

## Getting Started 

_Tableau_ produce a series of short videos to help you use _Tableau Online_ and _Tableau Desktop_ quickly.<br/>
Be sure to watch these through and download the data so that you can try each of the features out.

You can access all of the videos in turn from this link, but see the individual links below and the documentation, which identifies **Key concepts** that you should use and understand in each video. These are ideas, features and functionality that you should take away from the video and practice and use elsewhere.
