#### Why is it interesting?

Describes an applied context which needed multivariate time series spatial data to be explored at multiple scales. I love (geo)spatial data and thinking about how to use visualization to help make sense of them.

#### Why is it indicative?

I like doing applied work that benefits another community. I then like generalise from this to other applications.

#### Why is it interesting?


We build upon some theoretical work, and the software that Aidan produced to implement it, to apply thoughtful visualization to answer a complex and sociually important question with a nuanced graphical output that shows how the answer varies with (among other things) scale and space.

#### Why is it indicative?

I think the combination of a structured approach to design, the exploration of solutions that lie between traditional maps and more abstract information visualization, the grid and colour aesthetic, the 'interesting' stuff above and the way that this was motivated by an exciting unknown data set and a bright MSc student is pretty much what we aspire to achieve!

#### Why is it interesting?

It's a reflective critique of where data visualization, especially text visualization, falls short in political contexts such as civic decision-making. It draws on ~10 years of first-hand work with community members, the public, and decision-makers.

#### Why is it indicative?

It captures my research stance: community-centered, and oriented toward inclusive, representative and accessible visualization. It distills the new directions I believe our field must develop and validate.

#### Why is it interesting?

It is a fun project that gives students some idea about how AI could intersect with visualization research.

#### Why is it indicative?

It is short and won't give you a headache ðŸ˜‰

#### Why is it interesting?

This paper marks a shift in the way I had been approaching visualisation research. All my previous work in the US (before this paper) was focused on building visualisation software that catered to a very narrow group of stakeholders -what we usually refer to in vis literature as domain experts- such as biologists looking at genomic pathways, or scientists looking to reconstruct signals from a satellite.
The QualDash project (and paper) introduced me to a new problem space when I moved to the UK, where vast amounts of data are collected routinely by service providers such as the NHS. This led to a whole new set of questions around how visualisation can engage lay audiences (people who don't deal with data on a regular basis, but still need it to make better decisions).

#### Why is it indicative?

The structure of this paper is descriptive of a typical set of steps we undertake in applied vis research. With minor adjustments to fit the needs of the project, we applied the design study methodology to design, develop, and evaluate a vis prototype.

#### Why is it interesting?

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytical workflow with visualization playing key roles at all stages of data processing, applying computational methods, and interpreting results.

#### Why is it indicative?

Another representative approach for our work.

#### Why is it interesting?

Here we transform and even create new time scales and spatial representation for analysis of football data.


#### Why is it indicative?

We love to transform data, and love space, time and football
