		?? Why it's interesting to me. It's a reflective critique of where data visualization, especially text visualization, falls short in political contexts such as civic decision-making. It draws on ~10 years of first-hand work with community members, the public, and decision-makers.

		?? Why it is indicative of me and my approach to DataVis Research. It captures my research stance: community-centered, and oriented toward inclusive, representative and accessible visualization. It distills the new directions I believe our field must develop and validate.

		?? Why it is interesting to me. This paper marks a shift in the way I had been approaching visualisation research. All my previous work in the US (before this paper) was focused on building visualisation software that catered to a very narrow group of stakeholders -what we usually refer to in vis literature as domain experts- such as biologists looking at genomic pathways, or scientists looking to reconstruct signals from a satellite. The QualDash project (and paper) introduced me to a new problem space when I moved to the UK, where vast amounts of data are collected routinely by service providers such as the NHS. This led to a whole new set of questions around how visualisation can engage lay audiences (people who don't deal with data on a regular basis, but still need it to make better decisions).

		?? Why it is indicative of me and my approach to DataVis Research. The structure of this paper is descriptive of a typical set of steps we undertake in applied vis research. With minor adjustments to fit the needs of the project, we applied the design study methodology to design, develop, and evaluate a vis prototype.

	abstract     = {A possible objective in analyzing trajectories of multiple simultaneously moving objects, such as football players during a game, is to extract and understand the general patterns of coordinated movement in different classes of situations as they develop. For achieving this objective, we propose an approach that includes a combination of query techniques for flexible selection of episodes of situation development, a method for dynamic aggregation of data from selected groups of episodes, and a data structure for representing the aggregates that enables their exploration and use in further analysis. The aggregation, which is meant to abstract general movement patterns, involves construction of new time-homomorphic reference systems owing to iterative application of aggregation operators to a sequence of data selections. As similar patterns may occur at different spatial locations, we also propose constructing new spatial reference systems for aligning and matching movements irrespective of their absolute locations. The approach was tested in application to tracking data from two Bundesliga games of the 2018/2019 season. It enabled detection of interesting and meaningful general patterns of team behaviors in three classes of situations defined by football experts. The experts found the approach and the underlying concepts worth implementing in tools for football analysts.},

	abstract     = {Abstract The term 'episode' refers to a time interval in the development of a dynamic process or behaviour of an entity. Episode-based data consist of a set of episodes that are described using time series of multiple attribute values. Our research problem involves analysing episode-based data in order to understand the distribution of multi-attribute dynamic characteristics across a set of episodes. To solve this problem, we applied an existing theoretical model and developed a general approach that involves incrementally increasing data abstraction. We instantiated this general approach in an analysis procedure in which the value variation of each attribute within an episode is represented by a combination of symbols treated as a 'word'. The variation of multiple attributes is thus represented by a combination of 'words' treated as a 'text'. In this way, the the set of episodes is transformed to a collection of text documents. Topic modelling techniques applied to this collection find groups of related (i.e. repeatedly co-occurring) 'words', which are called 'topics'. Given that the 'words' encode variation patterns of individual attributes, the 'topics' represent patterns of joint variation of multiple attributes. In the following steps, analysts interpret the topics and examine their distribution across all episodes using interactive visualizations. We test the effectiveness of the procedure by applying it to two types of episode-based data with distinct properties and introduce a range of generic and data type-specific visualization techniques that can support the interpretation and exploration of topic distribution.}

		Jason ?? Why it's interesting to me. We build upon some theoretical work, and the software that Aidan produced to implement it, to apply thoughtful visualization to answer a complex and sociually important question with a nuanced graphical output that shows how the answer varies with (among other things) scale and space.

		?? Why it is indicative of me and my approach to DataVis Research. I think the combination of a structured approach to design, the exploration of solutions that lie between traditional maps and more abstract information visualization, the grid and colour aesthetic, the 'interesting' stuff above and the way that this was motivated by an exciting unknown data set and a bright MSc student is pretty much what we aspire to achieve!

  title={Design Exposition with Literate Visualization},

  volume={25},

  notes={
Why is it interesting?
It formalises what I have found to be a productive and under-appreciated way of working with data visualization design while providing practical support to allow it to happen. It also underpins the teaching philosophy behind part of what makes the CDT an innovation in PhD study.

Why is it indicative of you and your approach?
It combines visualisation design practice with visualization design research with teaching and learning. It is this intersection that interests me most. I enjoy the task of making theoretical contribution with practical support, often in the form of software, to assist in implementing the theory in practice.
